# HTML websites

I browse the web on desktop with JavaScript disabled by defaut. Whenever I encounter a cool website where I initially think that I’ll probably have to enable JavaScript to use it, but I then I end up not having to do that because the website made sure to work well without JavaScript, I add that wbsite to this list.
